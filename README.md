# Gargantext Purescript

## About this project

Gargantext is a collaborative web platform for the exploration of sets
of unstructured documents. It combines tools from natural language
processing, text-mining, complex networks analysis and interactive data
visualization to pave the way toward new kinds of interactions with your
digital corpora.

You will not find this software very useful without also running or being
granted access to a [backend](https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/haskell-gargantext).

This software is free software, developed by the CNRS Complex Systems
Institute of Paris ÃŽle-de-France (ISC-PIF) and its partners.

## Dependencies

The build requires the following system dependencies preinstalled:

* NodeJS (11+)
* Yarn (Recent)

### NodeJS

On debian testing, debian unstable or ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs yarn
```

On debian stable:

```shell
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs
```

<!-- TODO: wtf is all this sudo? -->
<!-- To upgrade to latest version (and not current stable) version, you can -->
<!-- use the `n` module from npm to upgrade node: -->

<!-- ```shell -->
<!-- sudo npm cache clean -f -->
<!-- sudo npm install -g n -->
<!-- sudo n stable -->
<!-- sudo n latest -->
<!-- ``` -->

On Mac OS X with homebrew:

```shell
brew install node
```

For other platforms, please refer to [the nodejs website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Yarn (javascript package manager)

On debian or ubuntu:

```shell
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn
```

On Mac OS X with homebrew:

```shell
brew install yarn
```

For other platforms, please refer to [the yarn website](https://www.yarnpkg.com/).

## Development

Once you have node and yarn installed, you may install deps with:

```shell
yarn install -D && yarn install-ps
```

You will likely want to check your work in a browser. We provide a
local development webserver that serves on port 5000 for this purpose:

```shell
yarn server
```

To generate a new browser bundle to test:

```shell
yarn build
```

If you are rapidly iterating and just want to type check your code:

```shell
yarn compile
```

You may access a purescript repl if you want to explore:

```shell
yarn repl
```

If you need to reinstall dependencies such as after a git pull or branch switch:

```shell
yarn install -D && yarn install-ps # both javascript and purescript
```

If something goes wrong building after a deps update, you may clean
build artifacts and try again:

```shell
yarn clean-js # clean javascript, very useful
yarn clean-ps # clean purescript, should never be required, possible purescript bug
yarn clean # clean both purescript and javascript
```

If you edit the SASS, you'll need to rebuild the CSS:

```shell
yarn css
```

<!-- A `purs ide` connection will be available on port 9002 while the -->
<!-- development server is running. -->

A guide to getting set up with the IDE integration is coming soon, I hope.

### Note to contributors

Please follow CONTRIBUTING.md

### How do I?

#### Change which backend to connect to?

Edit `Config.purs`. Find the function `endConfig'` just after the
imports and edit `back`. The definitions are not far below, just after
the definitions of the various `front` options.

Example (using `demo.gargantext.org` as backend):

```
endConfig' :: ApiVersion -> EndConfig
endConfig' v = { front : frontRelative
               , back  : backDemo v  }
```

#### Add a javascript dependency?

Add it to `package.json`, under `dependencies` if it is needed at
runtime or `devDependencies` if it is not.

#### Add a purescript dependency?

Add it to `psc-package.json` without the `purescript-` prefix.

If is not in the package set, you will need to read the next section.

#### Add a custom or override package to the local package set?

You need to add an entry to the relevant map in
`packages.dhall`. There are comments in the file explaining how it
works. It's written in dhall, so you can use comments and such.

You will then need to rebuild the package set:

```shell
yarn rebuild-set
```

#### Upgrade the base package set local is based on to latest?

```shell
yarn rebase-set && yarn rebuild-set
```

This will occasionally result in swearing when you go on to build.

## Theory Introduction

Making sense of out text isn't actually that hard, but it does require
a little background knowledge to understand.

### N-grams

N-grams are at the heart of how Gargantext makes sense out of text.

There are two common meanings in the literature for n-gram:
- a sequence of `n` characters
- a sequence of `n` words

Gargantext is focused on words. Here are some example word n-grams;

- `coffee` (unigram or 1-gram)
- `need coffee` (bigram or 2-gram)
- `one coffee please` (trigram or 3-gram)
- `here is your coffee` (4-gram)
- `i need some more coffee` (5-gram)

N-grams are matched case insensitively and across whole words. Examples:

| Text         | N-gram       | Matches              |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `Coffee cup` | `coffee`     | YES                  |
| `Coffee cup` | `off`        | NO, not a whole word |
| `Coffee cup` | `coffee cup` | YES                  |

You may read more about n-grams [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram).

<!-- TODO: Discuss punctuation -->

Gargantext allows you to define n-grams interactively in your browser
and explore the relationships they uncover across a corpus of text.

Various metrics can be applied to n-grams, the most common of which is
the number of times an n-gram appears in a document.

## Glossary

document
: One or more texts comprising a single logical document
field
: A portion of a document, e.g. `title`, `abstract`, `body`
corpus
: A collection of documents
n-gram/ngram
: A word or words to be indexed, consisting of `n` words.
  This technically includes skip-grams, but in the general case
  the words will be contiguous.
unigram/1-gram
: A one-word n-gram, e.g. `cow`, `coffee`
bigram/2-gram
: A two-word n-gram, e.g. `coffee cup`
trigram/3-gram
: A three-word n-gram, e.g. `coffee cup holder`
skip-gram
: An n-gram where the words are not all adjacent. Not yet supported.
k-skip-n-gram
: An n-gram where the words are at most distance k from each other.
