# Gargantext Purescript

## About this project

Gargantext is a collaborative web platform for the exploration of sets
of unstructured documents. It combines tools from natural language
processing, text-mining, complex networks analysis and interactive data
visualization to pave the way toward new kinds of interactions with your
digital corpora.

This software is a free software, developed by the CNRS Complex Systems
Institute of Paris ÃŽle-de-France (ISC-PIF) and its partners.

## Installation of this library

### Dependencies warning
This library purescript-gargantext is the Front End part of Gargantext.
you need the backend (haskell-gargantext) installation too.

### Installation steps

1. Add `node_modules/.bin` to your path
2. Execute `./build`

In one command:

```PATH="$PWD/node_modules/.bin:$PATH" ./build```

## Note to the contributors

Please follow CONTRIBUTING.md

## Introduction

Making sense of out text isn't actually that hard, but it does require
a little background knowledge to understand.x

### N-grams

N-grams are at the heart of how Gargantext makes sense out of text.

There are two common meanings in the literature for n-gram:
- a sequence of `n` characters
- a sequence of `n` words

Gargantext is focused on words. Here are some example word n-grams;

- `coffee` (unigram or 1-gram)
- `need coffee` (bigram or 2-gram)
- `one coffee please` (trigram or 3-gram)
- `here is your coffee` (4-gram)
- `i need some more coffee` (5-gram)

N-grams are matched case insensitively and across whole words. Examples:

| Text         | N-gram       | Matches              |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `Coffee cup` | `coffee`     | YES                  |
| `Coffee cup` | `off`        | NO, not a whole word |
| `Coffee cup` | `coffee cup` | YES                  |

You may read more about n-grams [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram).

Gargantext allows you to define n-grams interactively in your browser
and explore the relationships they uncover across a corpus of text.

Various metrics can be applied to n-grams, the most common of which is
the number of times an n-gram appears in a document.

## Glossary

document
: One or more texts comprising a single logical document
field
: A portion of a document, e.g. `title`, `abstract`, `body`
corpus
: A collection of documents
n-gram/ngram
: A word or words to be indexed, consisting of `n` words.
  This technically includes skip-grams, but in the general case
  the words will be contiguous.
unigram/1-gram
: A one-word n-gram, e.g. `cow`, `coffee`
bigram/2-gram
: A two-word n-gram, e.g. `coffee cup`
trigram
: A three-word n-gram, e.g. `coffee cup holder`
<!-- skip-grams are not yet supported -->
<!-- skip-gram -->
<!-- : An n-gram where the words are not all adjacent -->
<!-- k-skip-n-gram -->
<!-- : An n-gram where the words are at most distance k from each other -->
